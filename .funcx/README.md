# `funcX` endpoint creation

## Endpoint creation
To create a `funcX` endpoint in an virtual environment with the `funcx-endpoint` library installed (such as provided by `requirements.txt`) run

```console
$ funcx-endpoint configure pyhf
```

which will create a `funcX` configuration file at `~/.funcx/pyhf/config.py`.

## Endpoint configuration

The endpoint configuration can now be revised for the purposes of the studies needed.
The configuration file used for this analysis is the included `pyhf-config.py`.
